Based on our immediate previous 3 prompt responses lets continue your enhancement for any missing template-based generation patterns and data generation code that we should create or enhance into the below files

â”œâ”€â”€ data_generation/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ init.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ metrics.py         # Authenticity metrics

i would like us to finally analyze all the previous conversations for any code we have not incorporated for in the model training for 
Multi-task learning, Curriculum learning, Mixed precision training, Gradient accumulation.

Please update the evaluation.py by comparing with the attached latest code.
